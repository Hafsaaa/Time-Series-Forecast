# Description

Challenging Uni project for studying Time series prediction methods: statistical methods VS Machine Learning methods. 
Very instructive to learn key time series prediction methods.

Statistical Methods: ARIMA methods family (AR/ARMA/ARIMA). Stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, and is one of the most renowned statistical models.

Machine Learning Methods: LSTM neural networks. Stands for Long Shot Term Memory, and i one of the most advanced forms of Recurrent Neural Netwroks (RNN).

Detailed explanations of these models are provided inside the Jupyter Notebook, alongside comprehensive step by step commentary.


# Requirements 

All the code is written in Python 3.

The provided notebook can be used in Jupyter Notebook, requiring the installation of many modules, including key data science libraries: 
scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, sklearn, Keras.

Alternatively, you can use Google Colab to have a ready to use online environment with all libraries preloaded.


# Usage

The latest execution results are already cached in the notebook.

If you wish to rerun the notebook to tweak the parameters of the different models usedsimply launch it in Jupyter or Colab. Beware that the cached execution results will be lost.

The current LSTM Machine learning model used roughly takes 1 hour to show the final results on Google Colab.
