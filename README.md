# Description

Challenging Uni project for studying Time series prediction methods: statistical methods VS Machine Learning methods. 
Very instructive to learn key time series prediction methods.

Statistical Methods: ARIMA methods family (AR/ARMA/ARIMA). Stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, and is one of the most renowned statistical models.

Machine Learning Methods: LSTM neural networks. Stands for Long Shot Term Memory, and i one of the most advanced forms of Recurrent Neural Netwroks (RNN).

Detailed explanation of these models are provided inside the Jupyter Notebook, alongside comprehensive step by step commentary.
